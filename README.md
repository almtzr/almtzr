### Hi, Welcome to my github page. 
I am currently working on my personal project <a href="https://saandial.github.io/opencopter" target="_blank">Open Copter</a> a scalable modular drone prototype. It is a Open Source DIY project. All the hardware, software and electronics parts are available from the project github page. As I said this project is currently under development, so if you have any feedback or question, you can contact me.
